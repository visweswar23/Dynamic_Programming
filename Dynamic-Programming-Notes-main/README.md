- Note :- The two main approaches to DP problems are memoization(top-down approach) and tabulation (bottom-up approach)

While I was watching the videos, I saw , many a times he mispelled bottom up as top down . So it might reflect in the notes as well . Please keep this in mind while revising 

If you have any resources , please add.
